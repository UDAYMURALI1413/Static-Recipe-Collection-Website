                    <li>Marinate the Chicken: ombine chicken, yogurt, 1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste, half the mint and coriander, half the biryani masala, chili powder, turmeric, salt, and a squeeze of lemon in a large bowl. Mix well. Cover and marinate for at least 1 hour (or overnight in the fridge)</li>
                    <li>Prepare the Rice: Rinse the basmati rice several times and soak in water for 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Fry Onions & Sear Chicken: In a large pot, heat 2 tablespoons oil/ghee. Fry the sliced onions until golden brown and caramelized. Set aside half for layering.
                        <p>In the remaining oil, add whole spices (cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, bay leaves, cumin seeds if using). Sauté for 1 minute.</p>
                        <p>Add marinated chicken and cook on medium-high heat for 5-7 minutes until sealed. Add the remaining ginger-garlic paste, tomatoes, and green chilies. Cook until tomatoes soften and chicken is about 60-70% cooked</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Cook Rice: Meanwhile, boil 6-8 cups of water with salt in a large pot. Add soaked, drained rice. Boil until rice is 70-80% cooked (it should have a bite). Drain immediately.</li>
                    <li>Layer the Biryani: In the pot with cooked chicken, spread half the cooked rice evenly. Sprinkle some reserved fried onions, mint, coriander, biryani masala, and drizzle some saffron milk if using.
                        <p>Repeat with the remaining rice and toppings.  
                           Optionally, finish with melted ghee and a sprinkle of black pepper.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Dum Cooking (Steaming): Seal the pot tightly with foil or cover with a heavy lid. Cook on low heat for 20-25 minutes for the flavors to meld and rice to steam (“dum” method).
                        <p>Remove from heat and rest for another 10 minutes before opening.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Serve: Fluff up the biryani gently. Serve hot, garnished with extra fried onions and fresh herbs. Enjoy with raita or lemon wedges.</li>
                    
                    
                </ol>

                <p>Prep Time: 20 minutes (plus marination time)</p>
                <p>Cook Time: 45-60 minutes</p>
                <p>Servings: 5-6</p>

                <h5>Tips :</h5>
                <p>For best results, use long-grain basmati rice and bone-in chicken, and marinate the meat overnight for deep flavor.</p>
